------
This is a object Oriented Java based console banking application.<br>It was one of my first personal projects which I completed in my first year of university in 2019.
<br>It has features such as money transfers via IBAN's as well as depositing and withdrawing to your account.
<br>Moreover, accounts are pin protected
You can also check the history of all your transactions (Credits and Debits)
