# - Object Oriented Banking Application -
------
This is a object Oriented Java based console banking application. It was one of my first personal projects which I completed in my first year of university in 2019.
It has features such as money transfers via IBAN's as well as depositing and withdrawing to your account.
Moreover, accounts are pin protected
You can also check the history of all your transactions (Credits and Debits)
